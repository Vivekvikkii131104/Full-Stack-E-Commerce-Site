# Full-Stack E-Commerce Site

This project is a complete mini e-commerce website built as a final "elite challenge" for the Indikraft internship program. It demonstrates an end-to-end full-stack workflow, from a dynamic frontend UI to a simple backend API.

The site is a testament to the effort and learning invested, showcasing a professional, beautiful, and fully functional online shopping experience.

## Features

### Frontend (User Interface)
* **Product Listing:** A clean and modern homepage displaying a grid of products fetched dynamically from the backend.
* **Product Details:** Clicking on a product navigates to a dedicated page showing its full details.
* **Shopping Cart:** A functional cart where users can add products, update quantities, or remove items. The cart state is managed in the browser's local storage.
* **Checkout Flow:** A multi-step form to collect user information, simulate payment, and review the order.
* **Order Confirmation:** A final page displayed after a successful (dummy) order is placed.
* **Responsive Design:** The entire site is designed to be fully responsive, ensuring a seamless experience on both mobile and desktop devices.
* **Aesthetic UI/UX:** A carefully chosen color palette, modern typography (Google Fonts), and smooth transitions create a polished and engaging user experience.

### Backend (API & Data)
* **Node.js & Express.js:** A lightweight and efficient backend server built with Node.js and the Express.js framework.
* **Dummy Backend:** Utilizes local JSON files (`products.json`, `orders.json`) to simulate a real database. This setup allows for dynamic content without the complexity of a traditional database.
* **API Endpoints:**
    * `GET /api/products`: Fetches a list of all products.
    * `GET /api/products/:id`: Fetches a single product's details by its ID.
    * `POST /api/orders`: Receives and saves new order data, mimicking a real-world order placement process.
* **Static File Serving:** The backend is configured to serve all the frontend HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files from the `public/` directory.

## Technologies Used

* **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript, Font Awesome, Google Fonts
* **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
* **Data:** JSON
* **State Management (Frontend):** Browser's Local Storage

## How to Run the Project Locally

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git](https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git)
    cd YOUR_REPO_NAME
    ```
2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  **Start the Backend Server:**
    ```bash
    node server.js
    ```
4.  **Open in Browser:** Once the server is running, open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:3000`.

### Step 2: Prepare for GitHub and Deployment

* **Action:** Now, you need to push this finalized code (with the `README.md` file) to a new GitHub repository and then deploy it.
    * Follow the same Git steps we practiced:
        1.  In your terminal, inside `mini-ecom-fullstack`, run `git init`.
        2.  Run `git add .`
        3.  Run `git commit -m "Final version of full-stack e-commerce site"`
        4.  Go to GitHub, create a new empty repository (let's name this one something like `full-stack-ecom-final-project`).
        5.  Copy the remote commands from GitHub.
        6.  Run the commands in your terminal to `git push`.
    * **Once on GitHub, you can use Netlify to deploy it exactly as we did for your portfolio.**

### Step 3: Write a LinkedIn Post

* **Why:** To announce your major accomplishment and get noticed.
* **How:** I'll write a compelling post for you.

**LinkedIn Post Wording:**

**ðŸ”¥ Task #7: My final internship challenge is complete! ðŸŽ‰**

I'm incredibly proud to share my most ambitious project yet: a complete **Full-Stack E-Commerce Site**, built as the "elite challenge" for my internship with @Indikraft.

This isn't just a static site. This project taught me how to connect a frontend UI to a real backend, demonstrating a full end-to-end workflow.

**Key Highlights:**
* A fully functional product listing, cart, and checkout flow.
* Backend API built with **Node.js & Express.js**.
* Frontend powered by **Vanilla JS** for dynamic rendering.
* **Dummy payment integration** and order management.
* All wrapped in a professional and responsive design.

This project truly pushed my skills and solidified my understanding of how web applications work. A huge thanks to Indikraft for this incredible learning experience!

**Technologies:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js, JSON.

So, bhai, this is the entire plan for wrapping up this final project. You now have a completed, working codebase, a professional README, and a plan for deployment and showcasing it.

Let me know what you'd like to do first: start the Git process, or are you happy with the post wording?
